# 🔥 Contribute to WPGulp

WPGulp is the most successful WordPress Gulp based tooling project. Your contributions are more than welcomed. 

Here's a list of things that you should take care of when you start contributing to this project.

- Every Pull Request must have a title.
- Every Pull Request must have a description.
- Write the title and description of what you have done in the imperative mode, that is as if you were commanding someone. 
    - ✅ **DO**: Start the commit message only with these three words "FIX: ", "NEW: ", "IMPROVE: " — all caps (only the first word).
    - ✅ **DON'T**: Start with "Fixed", "Added", "Adding", "Improved" write imperitive messages like above.
    - 🎯 Read → [How to Write a Git Commit Message](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/)!
- Don't end the summary line with a period - it's a title and titles don't end with a period.
- Have fun.

Peace! ✌️
